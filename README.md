## Creating a crop map
To create a crop map run the following colab notebook (or use it as a guide): 
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/nasaharvest/crop-mask/blob/master/notebooks/inference.ipynb)

## Training a new model
To train a new model run the following colab notebook (or use it as a guide):
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/nasaharvest/crop-mask/blob/master/notebooks/train.ipynb)

Two models are trained - a multi-headed pixel wise classifier to classify pixels as containing crop or not, and a multi-spectral satellite image forecaster which forecasts a 12 month timeseries given a partial input:

## Adding new labeled data

To add new labeled data run the following colab notebook (or use it as a guide):

## Setting up a local environment
Ensure you have [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos) installed.
#### 1. For development 
Ensure you have [gcloud](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) installed.
```bash
conda install mamba -n base -c conda-forge  # Install mamba
mamba env create -f environment-dev.yml     # Create environment with mamba (faster)
conda activate landcover-mapping            # Activate environment
gcloud auth application-default login       # Authenticates with Google Cloud
```

#### 2. For shapefile notebook
```bash
conda env create -f environment-lite.yml    # Create environment
conda activate landcover-lite               # Activate environment
jupyter notebook
```

## Tests

The following tests can be run against the pipeline:

```bash
flake8 . # code formatting
mypy .  # type checking
python -m unittest # unit tests

# Integration tests
python -m unittest test/integration_test_labeled.py
python -m unittest test/integration_test_model_bbox.py
python -m unittest test/integration_test_model_evaluation.py
```
